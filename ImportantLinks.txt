Dotnet Core EF Core issues when dont write it correctly.

1. Default data tyoe is nvarchar(max) which is issue it will take huge space and performance issue
2. use to specify maxlength  or use varchar(some length)
3. using include for all data is bad idea use top to reduce count
4. DoNot use C# custom function onto Where Clause for Ef Core query
5. Dont return DbContext Models directly becuase jsonSerializer dont like birirection relationship beause dbcontext classes has mapping to each other
